          <h4>Project Introduction</h4>
          <br>

          <h4><mark>Analysis on the Impact of Russia-Ukraine Conflict to the Commodity Market using Reddit data</mark>
          </h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            During this year, the financial market is having extra turmoil due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine Conflict.
            Figure 1 and 2 show the event effect of Russia-Ukraine conflict on S&P 500 index and Wheat price.
            This project aims to study this event from a perspective combining the commodity market with online social
            media Reddit. Modern finance theory holds that asset prices are mainly affected by market and psychological
            factors. From the market perspective, global economies are presently facing severe challenges due to food
            and energy shortages, since
            Ukraine and Russia are among the major exporters of wheat, natural gas, etc. From the behavioral finance
            perspective, geopolitical conflict can have an impact on investors' psychological factors, which in turn can
            have an impact on commodity prices. This project will explore the relationship between the food and energy
            commodity market and Russia-Ukraine related Reddit posts, in hope that the data can capture both market and
            psychological factors. If another emergent event happens in the future, a similar approach can be conducted
            to evaluate the impact on commodity markets.

            To be able to analyze the Reddit data in an efficient and quantitative way, we borrow techniques from the
            burgeoning Natural Langauge Processing(NLP) field including Topic Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, Language
            Detection, etc. For the regression taks of predicting returns, we experiment a suite of machine learning(ML)
            algorithms including Lasso/Ridge Regression, Principal Component Regression, Random Forest, Gradient
            Boosting, and Neural Network.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Reddit is a large community with thousands of hundreds of users that have a large volume of information,
            we utilize Big Data Processing tool Spark to handle the heavy data lifting. Our ultimate goal to predict
            commodity market returns using Reddit data breaks down into three sections. EDA section introduces the
            commodity and reddit datasets with their summary statistics. NLP section demonstrates our feature
            engineering pipeline and our two feature categories: Reddit Topics, and Reddit Sentiment. Machine Learning
            section explains the prediction algorithms and their results. And lastly, Conclusion section summarizes the
            project and discusses the next steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout our project, we will answer below data science questions as
            milestones to help us reach the final goal.

                corresponding topic. As a potential next step, we may even apply methods like word2vec/doc2vec to
                compute the document vectors, project them to lower dimensional(TSNE/UMAP/PCA) space, and visualize
                them.

                  Feb with the average price changes before that time with consideration of standard deviation. 3) It is

                  The goal is to examine economic data such as export/import from Russia and Ukraine to identify if the

                  be
                  found between historical export/import and commodity market prices. Having an understanding of the

                  Starting from the naïve Pearson correlation, this project will explore which commodities tend to move
                  together. Since new events can introduce changes to commodity fundamentals, it is also important to
                  compare the correlation before and after the conflict. To consider lag and lead effects, this project
                  can conduct cross-correlation analysis as a next step.

                  is
                  to experiment with different predicting models to test if the next-day price change can be modeled by
                  using the psychological factors we derived from previous univariate analyses. Some potential models
                  include OLS, Lasso/Ridge Regression, Tree-based methods, and neural networks. Identify which asset can
                  be predicted most/least accurately.
